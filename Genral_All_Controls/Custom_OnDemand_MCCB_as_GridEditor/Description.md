## Description 

This solution provides a C# and a VB.NET projects demonstrating how to implement a custom MultiColumnComboBox using RadPopupEditor and RadGridView. The example demonstrates how you can use the new custom control as editor in a separate grid as well. Since the grid is not directly tied up with the text box of the popup editor, the data can be loaded on demand as the user types.
