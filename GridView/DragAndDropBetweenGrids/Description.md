## Description 

This solution aims to show you a sample approach how to extend the **RadGridView** control to enable drag and drop functionality between two grids, whether it be an unbound grid, bound to a binding list of objects, or bound to a DataSet. It supports the ability to drag and drop multiple rows at a time. A complete step by step tutorial is available in the [Drag and drop](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/winforms/controls/gridview/rows/drag-and-drop) article.
