## Description 

This solution provides a C# and a VB.NET projects demonstrating how to create a custom row that measure all cells (by default only the visible cells are measured). This solution uses cached row height as well and this improves the performance. Detailed information about this is available here: https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/winforms/gridview/rows/how-to/autosize-entire-row
