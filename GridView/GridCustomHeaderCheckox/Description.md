## Description 

This solution provides a C# and a VB.NET projects demonstrating how to create a custom CheckBoxHeaderCellelement. This allows you manually handle the checkbox state changing and perform operation only on a specific rows. This particular example demonstrates how you can check only the currently visible rows. If you filter the grid the hidden rows would not be checked.
